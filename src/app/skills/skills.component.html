                        These are my programming languages, with python being my primary. I have used python to write software implementing 
                        neural networks from scratch, fundamental AI (bayes nets, RL, etc.), bioinformatics, etc. Javascript I have experience
                        using for web development, and Java I learned as my first object oriented langauge.

                        My work in deep learning has consisted of training NN for many tasks, including computer vision, 
                        NLP, and unsupervised categorization tasks. I have also constructed from scratch heterogeneous graph
                        transformer, where I analyzed architecture performance as well as potential optimizations.
